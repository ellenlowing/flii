# fly vs human

It is an asymmetrical 2-player game where one player catches mosquitoes and the other plays as a mosquito. In front of a webcam, the mosquito-catcher uses their hand to capture the mosquito, while the mosquito uses a joystick to try and evade capture and suck blood out of the catcher's hand.
